The study done by american council of health sciences has confirmed that we should not be sitting for more than 6 hours a day , we should be standing or moving as Humans thats how muscles are made, sitting for 6 hours plus 9 hours of lying in bed just rusts the body.

So get up from your seat every 30 minutes for your own health and focus .Its ok to not have 1 hour or 2 hour long sessions of focussed work , i need to tackle my health problem first than this.
More than 50% of the awake time of the day should be spent moving or doing tasks/ activities (anything but sitting.)
