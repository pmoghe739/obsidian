I get very anxious in important moment in Life, I also do a lot of overthinking , where i am constantly thinking , one of the reasons of this could be my dealing with ADHD , it causes me to get bored very quickly with the current task, that coupled with my gaming hobby makes my Mind wander a lot whenever i am doing any task that is simple or boring.(Gaming was the only thing that could keep my mind occupied for longer duration of time because of my [[Reduced attention Span ]] .)
I am 30 years old and still so involved in gaming because it is the only thing that can keep my brain focussed for 15 minutes straight , no other activity can keep my brain attention towards it for more than 2-3 minutes, this is also probably the reason for my failure at you know what .

The problem has gone to such severe level that i cannot solve even simple problems and i have to lookout for syam's help on trivial matters . Along with this to even focus on single task i have to write it down on paper else i will forget it , this is called [[Brain Fog]].  For example yesterday i wrote 3 simple code examples that i should have been able to remember but i don't  getmoneymovement type, getinstrument type, get instruction type, I only changed these methods so i should be able to do it but i was not able to remember and hence i had to write it down.
Practise the solutions mentioned and eventually it will become better .


**The Solution :**
- The Biggest and Best solution out there is to practise [[MindFull]].
- Take Deep Breaths.
- Focus on only one task, Push my brain to that task only , no matter how boring it is force the brain to do that only and nothing else. Since brain is very nuero plastic , eventually it will learn to focus attention span on single task only.
- Indulge in various activities outdoor activities like socialising , cooking , cleaning with mindfullness.
- Avoiding screentime should also help with PMO since many times i have noticed , i see something exciting on youtube or insta and then one thing leads to anathor i what have we got here is a relapse.
