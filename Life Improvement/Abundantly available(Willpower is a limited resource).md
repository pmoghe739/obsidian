It is so difficult to break free of porn addiction is its easy accesibility and availability everywhere. I am constantly surrounded by screens .
Being surrounded by my mobile + office laptop + personal laptop and trying to get rid of this addiction is like a drug addict trying to get rid of his drug addiction while whole day sitting in a room full of different types of drugs, he may be able to resist the urges for 1 day or 2 days but eventually he will fall (FAIL) and that's what happens with me , to go cold tukey i must attack the problem at source, i must remove all alone screen time. So that gaming + P will move away from my life, and i can finally be a STRONG MAN , not just some wimp who stays online on his Computer all day and plays video games or watches porn.I need to keep the Mobile away from sight, i need to keep the Laptop locked and shutted down when i am alone, only use these two when in presence of Amu so that i do not have to fight the cravings.
