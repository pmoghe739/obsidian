From morning till evening i am browsing news/ reddit and all other information Systems and it is Bombarding my brain with Dopamine and information .

What this causes is , it confuses my brain with whats important and what's not, then brain does not retain the important information and also due to processing so much data , brain is already tired by the evening for anything, so keep myself as much away from Smart devices as possible, Keep screen-time below 10 hours for Mobile + Laptop.
Brain activity of new information should be similar to that of ancestors , less information spanned over longer time , because just like eating , if you eat very fast very few of the nutrient is digested and retained most of it just comes and goes , same with information and through if i read 200 thoughts in the day and do not ponder / process / Think on even a few of them nothing will be retained , Instead if i just ponder and read about 10 ideas/thoughts in my day i would be able to process/digest them and would be able to retain that as a life long journey.

Instead when getting bored , journal your ideas somewhere .
The thing is, when you are constantly consuming content, you have two problems. You get stressed due to information overload and you lose your creative powers.When you allow yourself to be bored, you will see that you are more rooted in the moment and at peace.
I guarantee you will learn that boredom actually enriches your life. Boredom makes your mind wander. When you are constantly entertained, you will never be creative.
