**MORNING**

> Before Starting work spend 5 minutes on all my tasks for today and schedule them , allocate them time , that way i'll know that by the end of the day what will i have accomplished .

**AFTERNOON**
- Try to avoid Office laptop with personal use like watching twitch streams or YouTube or Reddit, Once it is blocked it will massively boost my productivity since my brain will not associate this laptop with Fun and timepass but only with Work.
  Same thing is use your brain as a tool and make it work for you rather than it making you work.
- Try to Keep total Screen Time through out the day Under 8 hours, This includes (Office laptop + Mobile + Personal Laptop) Find other stuff to do like journal on copy/pen, read from kindle, workout . 


**NIGHT**
- Avoid taking laptop to Bed as much as possible, Instead use mobile , it is very bad for posture and neck to use laptop while sleeping position, it is what is causing me neck turning pain and will eventually lead to spondylitis.
