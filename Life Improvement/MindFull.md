Mindfullness and Mindfull Meditation
Mindfullness is the practise of being fully involved in the current activity and not thinking about past , future or any other topic, it is through this practise that i can cure my [[ADHD & Anxiety]] problem .It will also make me less tired and will lead to [[Great Results]] in all fields because by doing only one activity at hand and giving 100% attention of my brain to that activity i would achieve perfection. 

Start by going small , baby steps:

1. While Cooking, Cleaning other chores fully focus on just that chore and nothing else.
2. If thinking about something , than give full attention to that thought and all thoughts associated with it for full 15 minute slot, Do not do [[Context switching]] because it is very costly in terms of focus energy and results.
3. While coding start with a smaller pomodoro and force my brain to not switch context no matter how much distraction i get for atleast 5 minutes straight, eventually increasing it to 25 minutes , thats how i will achieve greatness.
