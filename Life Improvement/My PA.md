My addiction is the sole cause and reason for my problems.
I could not give amu the life she deserved, the life she wanted .
That's why she behaved the way she behaves .Uski bhi iccha thi loving husband mile sab kare mera .although she did hide a few things but because i was too weak , i had no self esteem i reacted the way i did, not the way i should have . I was not a man , i was just a teen child with Porn and video game addiction .
Till date she has trust issues with me, remember jab use pata chala is addiction ke bare me uska dil hi tut gaya .
Agar ye addiction nahi hota toh i could have taken sterner steps and things would have been different with papa and oxy-concentrator .
I dont want to repeat that in future.
I have wasted 2 years of her life , i don't want to waste any more moment.

I need to grow the fuck Up, be a MAN, stop being addicted to porn or video games, That will raise self esteem and help me deal with stuff better .
Give her and others around me the life they desrve not fake love.
So the next time you have an urge to view anything sexually explicit , porn , just remember your dying father asking for oxygen concentrator and  you could not provide it because if this addiction.

Root cause of my addiction is trigger, today i got triggered reading about Bjs in relationship sub reddit, reddit is a fucking double edged sword on one hand it helps but on anathor it triggers me , STEPS i need to take are 

1) identify places where i need to be extra careful like bathroom NEVER take PHONE with you, sooner or later it causes a RELAPSE.
2) Stop Browsing reddit it does more harm than good, i already know all the information that i need to know about this addiction.
3) It only causes trigger some way or the other and at this stage of addiction i cannot risk it.
4) Be very [[MindFull]] about using my phone and Laptop, only use them if i intend to do something with them, DO NOT PICK UP PHONE OUT OF BOREDOM, this is the root cause of every problem
