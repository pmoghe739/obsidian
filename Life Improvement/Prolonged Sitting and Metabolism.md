According to this news article, prolonged sitting can be equated to smoking, just after 30 minutes of continuous sitting  -> â€œMetabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where it can get burned off, slow down. The muscles in your lower body are turned off. And after two hours, good cholesterol drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is good to get things going again.

As the article says just getting up for 5 Minutes is good to get things going again, which is what majority of the population does, but for me as a GAMER i was sitting continuously for so many long hours that my metabolism and consequentially my T levels have dropped Very Low.

REMEMBER TO GET UP AND WALK EVERY 5 MINUTES, i do that while working like all NORMAL people but when gaming i forget about it and whole day i do not even get up to get drinking water from downstairs even though i am hungry.
