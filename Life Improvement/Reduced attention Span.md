My attention Span has drastically reduced because i am too much over stimulated all the time, Whether it be video games/ dota or PMO. This constant stream of dopamine has caused my brain to constantly jump from one distraction onto anathor.

But to achieve anything meaningful we must have long term focus and attention to a single task , thats when the HARD problems get solved.The number one correction i need to do is start using headphones to avoid external distractions while coding , Just think like this when i used to study or code at night i would get so much work done because there was so less distraction present, during the day even if nobody is directly talking to me there are lots of random noises that pop up, but at night when there is nobody around i can clearly see the difference in my work output and productivity.
STEP 1: Practice to use headphones to avoid external noises.
STEP 2: Find a way to cancel external noise during the day so that i can focus with much more energy during the day and i don't have to rely upon  Music to boost my productivity.
