We learn so much through out the day with internet and books readily available, But it is impossible to retain all this knowledge without timely Revision. Like i used to learn poems in my childhood, the most effective way to retain information is to keep revisiting it at a spaced interval , thats how i also learned coding problems for interviews .

So timely and spaced Intervals will help me remember what i learnt and make me a knowledgeable person in the Long Term which is my Ultimate Goal.

REVISE EVERYTHING FROM TIME TO TIME.
Start with your own notes and mind Maps.
