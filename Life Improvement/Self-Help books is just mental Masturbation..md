All the time i spend reading books i fee; i am learning, i am gaining knowledge, but knowledge is nothing without action, without experience. We tend to forget all that we learnt if we do not practice it, if we do not take action on it.

That is why the technique of revision was introduced to retain knowledge. But converting that knowledge to Intelligence requires ACTION.

It is very easy to go on reading one book after anathor after anathor, but how many did i actually practice, how many did i actualy incorporate in my life.I spent 10 hours reading why you should quit reddit, yet i am still on REDDIT. Majority of self help books are same common concept(common sense) taught over and over again in lengthy chapters, instead of just reading on them i should do actual action.
	Reading all this while It all made me feel as if I was laying the foundation for my career. I thought that if I was knowledgeable in all these fields, then I would be able to turn that knowledge into a business/successful life
	Well, it’s not like I didn’t actively do something productive.
	
But then, the reality is that a lot of people who ‘commit’ to this idea, are really just spending all of their time reading. Reading is not (necessarily) learning. It is just what it is — reading.

It can be a good way of helping you to solve problems that you are already working on.

It can help you to look at an issue you are facing from a new perspective, and therefore push you forward. It can also fill a void of knowledge, that will help you solve a problem you previously were stuck on.

But reading just for its own sake, if it’s done excessively, is not going to help you get anywhere.

	**You can’t read yourself to success.**

Reading should be a supporting activity. It should be something that you do to acquire theoretical knowledge that will contribute to your practical skills.

But in order for reading to support your your practical skills, you first need to have practical skills. Without them, all knowledge in the world isn’t going to lead you anywhere.

> Go out, do stuff and make mistakes. When you are stuck with something, read smartly to get an idea of how to overcome that challenge.

This doesn’t mean that reading can not be done for its own sake. But then, it should be [[reading for joy and out of curiosity]]
Reading like all other things should be done Mindfully. Their should be a **PURPOSE TO READ**, and that purpose should be based on or backed by an action.Some demand to do something, some PROBLEM to Solve.
	For example, one issue I am constantly struggling with is how to write articles that appeal to the emotions of my readers.
	
	In those circumstances, I test out different strategies for getting people to become interested in my articles, until I do not find any way to improve on my own.
	
	Then, I grab a book on the subject and search for something I haven’t tried yet. One single strategy that appeals to me is sufficient at this point.
	
	All I do is to test this one strategy for a while.
	
	If it is a success, great. I then start practicing it more and more until I mastered it. If it is a failure, then I will move on to something else.

In this way, reading becomes a purposeful activity, as opposed to it being something that you do for its own sake.

	All the knowledge in the world is at our disposal at all times. And yet, when it
 comes to practice, we all have to start working our way up from zero.

# Call to action:

There are only two valid reasons two read:

1.  For pleasure or out of curiosity
2.  For a purpose

Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you are making progress in different aspects of your life just because you are reading a lot. Reading helps as a supporting factor, not as ‘the way of learning’.

Try putting away your books away for a week or two and just do. Get out there and create something. Be productive.

Just compare what you have accomplished in that period of time with what you normally would have achieved if you had kept reading the way you usually do.

Once that time is over, find one problem that you came across in this period of time.

Find a book about the topic, and find one single solution that you can apply right away.

Then just do it.
