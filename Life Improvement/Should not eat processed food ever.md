	Do not ever eat processed food from a packet for one month, bahar ka samosa etc allowed hai but factory processed not at all allowed.
Isi ke karan mujhe itni gas aur bloating hone lag gayi hai ajkal, bahar se order karta hoon , ek toh usme hota hai maida, dusra point ki wo log kitna din purana khana rakhte hai usme tamsic properties aa jati hai.
According to AYURVEDA  
	FOOD SHOULD BE CONSUMED WITHIN 1.5 HOURS OF PREPARING IT.

But i eat food prepared from factory made items which have chemicals to boost their shelf Life. Aur Hotel wale kharidte bhi Bulk me hai taki sasta pade.

Mere sare problems ek vicious cycle ke karan hai.

Watch Porn -> play video Games-> become inactive and lazy-> not eat at time-> have huge cravings for tasty food -> order food from swiggy ->  high in carbs and pre-> cooked meal jisme bas tadka daalke usne pack kar diya, Dal subah ki bani hui hai raat me late hain aur thanda khate hai 1 hour ki delivery ke baad.
