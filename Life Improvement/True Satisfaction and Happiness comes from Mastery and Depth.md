True satisfaction and Happiness comes from Depth of knowledge/Understanding on the subject Matter.
Agar sare topics ki books roj thodi thodi padhta rahunga toh kisi bhi topic me substance nahi banega, kisi bhi topic me MASTERY nahi banegi. Jaise PAPA ne Astrology me Mastery kar li thi, toh uski itni value thi aur usko satisfied feel hota tha.

Ek hi Topic ko choose karo aur uspe pura research maar ke expect ban jao. Usi TOPIC pe sari books padho lagatar, bina dusre topic me jaye.This is also what Cal Newport means with deep knowledge. Pehle ek topic par pura research maarke uske master ban jao fir hi dusre pe jao.Aise ek - ek book padhke half knowedge se koi satisfaction nahi milega.Jaise Reddit ke early users ke paas substance hota tha, jo wo likhte the us content me dum hota tha factss and backing thi, if i have to write on any topic of my choice right now i cannot write 2 paragraphs on anything without googling jo ki impressive lage.
Remember the satisfaction i got after giving that session on Celery , it was because i went into the depth of celery and Mastered the concepts.
