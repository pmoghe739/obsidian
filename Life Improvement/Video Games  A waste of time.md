Earlier also when i was playing they were a very big waste of time taking my screen time in the day to always in the two figures .
Even now if i am not gaming i am thinking about it or watching others play on twitch or youtube streams.
5000 Hours of Dota , thats such a big waste of time in which i could have learned adulting , took care of important aspects of life , like manliness, but i was a kid all the time, just i could code and hence was given money but i was not a man capable of handling all scenarios like an adult.
The 5000 hours above is not even counting the time spent watching Blue span or other twitch streams .

SAVE YOUR TIME AND DO ADULTING INSTEAD OF PLAYING/ WATCHING VIDEO GAMES LIKE A KID.

STOP BEING A KID IN A MAN'S BODY.
