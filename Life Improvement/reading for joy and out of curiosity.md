Self help books are just a Form of Mental masturbation. If all i do is read but do not take any action on it , it is a very wastefull activity in terms of time because anyways i am not going to remember any of that in a week's time. The only book i read with intention and who's concepts i still remember is [[Deep Work]] from Cal newport, because i had a problem in my mind and i used that book to expand my knowledge in that Domain.

So this brings us to next point than why read?
Because if i am not doing any action right now or reading than i would be mindlessly scrolling Reddit / youtube/ netflix/ Twitch. So it is still better for the Eyes and Mind to just read a book cause it is Slow Knowledge, so read for Pleasure and read Fiction,

When i want to read self-improvement Book or anything , than do not choose just any book , first think if a Problem that needs to be solved, than Try all different approaches to solve it, once it is not solved than refer a book(or multiple) on that perticular Subject and try all different Ideas presented in the book, take ACTUAL ACTION on that problem and analyse the results, this way the Solution and that knowledge will become information and will be retainied in My Mind Forever.

Some problems to work on(Remember Take action first , List out all solutions that i can think of At the Moment and if not satisfied with the Outcomes than refer a book with purpose in mind and read thatbook MindFully, the book may not exactly be related to that problem but if i am reading it mindfully with my problem in mind I would be in a Best Position to make use of that )
