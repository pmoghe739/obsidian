IPP stand for Instrument Payment processing event.
The scenario is that driving message for PostD(amqpespostD) is TE message, but for two scenarios we do not receive TE message i.e. **Zero_dollar_auth** and **random charges**. previously for these scenarios we would not find TE message and that request will get killed in postingD side only, Than our(writeserv) downstream systems would need to look-up this Information in ARSON DB in ace because only they have that information. Ideally we want to be the ultimate source of truth and encompass all payment related informations from FPDA tables.
So this project by keshav and naveen is that we created a separate API in requestEventHandler and builders. Here since we do not have TE message we only have payment instructions so we will populate FPDA tables like card_transaction and credit_transaction from Payment Instructions, only changed fields are those that are being built from instrument_txn and party_txn.
