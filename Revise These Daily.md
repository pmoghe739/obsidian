1> Eat atleast 90g of protein everyday., [[Should not eat processed food ever]]

2> Stop using phone and screens all the time they encourage sedantary behaviour.[[Being Sedantary]][[Prolonged Sitting and Metabolism]]. Sitting is the problem of my sedantary behaviour and low T.

3> Problem with my screen addictions(Dota and Porn) is that they are always with me , i am always within a hands reach of either my phone or a LAPTOP, every waking hour of my day. Its like an alcohol addict sitting all day in a bar or a Wine cellar and trying to fight the addiction. Jab koi nahi dekh raha hoga aur kisi ko pata nahi chalega tab wo insaan kabhi na kabhi peg marega hi, will-power weak padegi hi.I need to put systems in place so that i CANNOT watch or play even if i want to , and also that i spend as little as possible time with my screens.(The easiest way is to keep a Book handy at all times.)

4> Just reading self Help books all the time and not implementing anything will not make any difference, it is the ACTION that actually changes anything, jo book padhi hai wo toh 1 week me bhul bhi jaunga. lekin jo action liya, habit banai wo lifetime benefit degi. Do not read Self-Help books they are just [[Self-Help books is just mental Masturbation.]].

5> Stay clear from online nudity, better stay away from online browsing during my recovery, because even the online sight of something hot, or semi nude also induces the same dopamine response and causes my desensitization to real life woman.

6-> avoid [[Information Overload]]
