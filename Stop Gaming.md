Solo queue dota is the worst. Remember the NP that picked offflane, than ask for carry role and when not given(because other player choose pos 1) still went carry, and we did not have any front liner. Ye ek chutiye ki wajah se mera itna frustration badh gaya aur 1 ghanta barbad ho gaya.
No more ever MMORPG, jab b hi khelunga single Player game hi khelunga , ya fir Party me ek do Games.

Games lost and countless hours lost because there is this one retard in your team that does not play his role. This also means  the games i have won were not all because of skill but because of some other loser playing not in their role. Plus lately you can clearly see i just pick mirana and do miniscule damage, and just hit arrow and than do nothing else maybe 300 damage with starfall to one hero,because if she goes 1 step in she directly dies.
