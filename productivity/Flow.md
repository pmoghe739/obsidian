Flow is required for [[Deep Work]] .
Flow is a state where you get completely lost in what you are doing and just focus on the present task. It produces magical outputs as highlighted by Cal Newport in his works.

To reach flow though one should avoid [[Context switching]] at all costs , because it has a neurological cost associated with it. Doing 5 tasks for 5 mins each will never produce any significant output . 
Significant output is only produced when deep focussed work for longer duration is done.
So always allocate minimum time block of 25 minutes before moving on to the next task.
Also we only have limited mental energy through out the day as mentioned in [[Make time]] book, i need to focus that energy on my highlight through flow.
Finish all my work by 6:00 PM and have time to recharge , since i am never recharging other than sleep (every waking hour is spent in front of screen consuming media (consuming media like youtube also has mental cost to it, since brain need to process it), i am always tired and cannot focus for long, because i have depleted my reserves) even simple activities like reading some productivity hack / book or watching video has mental cost , and since i did that after all day of work , i cant remember and retain it and fully understand it. Anathor loss is i am not recharged enough for tomorow.
So bottomline is **Finish all mind involving work by 6:00 PM , it includes learning from books / video lectures / productivity blogs . Use the time in evening to recharge, do activities that require very low to nil mental energy like cooking/ eating/ not consuming media / reading Fiction novels . These SIMPLE ACTIVITIES WILL HELP ME RECHARGE FOR PRODUCTIVITY TOMORROW .** Rest and mental recharge should start happening from evening and not just while sleeping. Sone se pehle reduce media consumption to very low.
