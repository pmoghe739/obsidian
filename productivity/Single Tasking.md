It works Like magic, my productivity goes through the roof, I am able to finish tasks so quickly, and i am not tired at all mmentally..All i need to take care of is that my focus should be the same as when i am playing DOTA or watching prn.(Even if the Task is very boring)
This single focussed playing dota is why it is so satisfying , when i haveto check phone or work in playing dota, even when DOTA is so interesting , that perticular game sucks because i was distracted. 
So why not extend the same behaviour into WORK and every aspect of LIFE, when i am doing one thing, no matter how boring it would be always just do that.No other thoughts, just slow your mind it should not think anything else.
Practice to bring mind again and again to the task at hand by breathing meditation practice.And also be mindful of what task currently i am forcing my Mind to be on.
